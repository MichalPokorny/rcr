# RCR

A basic Ruby OCR library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rcr'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rcr

RCR requires RMagick and it has some problems with installing
on systems that have ImageMagick built with enabled HDR. If you
encounter problems with RMagick installation, try building ImageMagick
without HDR.
